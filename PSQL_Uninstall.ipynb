    "1. )\tThe main issue is that I removed Home Brew a few months ago and it has caused some issues with compatibility and running certain software now. Today I realized that my PSQL was gone and I assume was bound to Brew installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. )\tBecause of this I am now searching what to do and install the new version. I decided to blindly use: PSQL website and a third party install on the top of the page. This was a fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. )\tI then decided to install the APP version, which was good and bad.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a.)\tI was able to use the terminal and see that it was enabled but the password was an issue.\n",
    "    b.)\tI had no idea what the password was and had to start deleted each install and try to start over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now find all hidden files for PSQL and what versions I have and remove. After I do this try a new install.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. )\tIf the password or user are still there after re-install for 2nd or 3rd time now. I need to get into the files by PSQL and change parameters\n",
